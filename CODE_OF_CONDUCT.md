# Animate UI – Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

We are committed to making participation in the Animate UI community a respectful, safe, and welcoming experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or harmful conduct in any form.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Being kind, patient, and respectful.
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback.
- Assuming good faith and collaborating to reach the best outcome for the community.
- Recognizing that different skills, backgrounds, and viewpoints lead to better ideas.

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Discriminatory language or imagery.
- Violence, threats, or encouraging self-harm.
- Sexualized or overly explicit language or imagery.
- Disruptive trolling or sustained interruption of discussion.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission (“doxing”).
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code applies within all community spaces—GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and any community communication channels. It also applies when a person is officially representing the project in public.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation, please contact the maintainers at **contact@animate-ui.com**. Provide as much detail as possible, including links, screenshots, dates, and context. Reports will be reviewed in good faith and handled as confidentially as possible.

We aim to acknowledge every report within **72 hours** and to follow up with next steps or a resolution timeline.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. When inappropriate behavior is reported or observed, maintainers will take any action they deem appropriate to foster a safe community.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When addressing violations, maintainers may use the following graduated responses:

1. **Correction**

   - _Impact:_ Minor, first-time issue.
   - _Consequence:_ A private or public note identifying the issue and requesting a change in behavior.

2. **Warning**

   - _Impact:_ A single significant incident or a series of problems.
   - _Consequence:_ A clear warning about the behavior’s impact and expectations going forward. Continued violations may lead to temporary or permanent restrictions.

3. **Temporary Restriction**

   - _Impact:_ Repeated or more serious violations.
   - _Consequence:_ Temporary limitations on participation (e.g., commenting, contributing, access to certain spaces).

4. **Permanent Ban**
   - _Impact:_ Severe or sustained violations (including harassment, discrimination, or threats).
   - _Consequence:_ Permanent removal from community spaces.

## Appeals

If you believe an action was taken in error or was unfair, you may reply to the original decision email with any additional context for reconsideration. A different maintainer (or a small subgroup) will review appeals when possible.
