## What's new?

**Animate UI** is no longer in beta.

In order to make Animate UI more accessible and simpler, we are introducing a new organization.
Animate UI is now divided into three parts:

- **Primitives**: Primary components, animated but without style.
- **Components**: Ready-to-use components styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons**: Animated icons based on Lucide Icons.

**All components have been reworked** to be improved and optimized.
