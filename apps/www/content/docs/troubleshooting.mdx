## Verify your versions

| Dependency       | Minimum recommended version |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Motion**       | `≥ 12.23.0`                 |
| **React**        | `≥ 19`                      |
| **Tailwind CSS** | `≥ 4.1.0`                   |
| **Base UI**      | `1.0.0-beta.3`              |
| **Radix UI**     | `≥ 1.4.0`                   |
| **Headless UI**  | `≥ 2.2.0`                   |

Make sure your environment meets or exceeds these versions to ensure Animate UI remains compatible and stable.

## Documentation display issues

Certain browser extensions can interfere with how the documentation is rendered. Common culprits include:

- **[Screen Shader | Smart Screen Tinting](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/screen-shader-smart-scree/fmlboobidmkelggdainpknloccojpppi?hl=fr&utm_source=ext_sidebar)**

If problems persist after disabling extensions, clear your browser cache and refresh the page.

## The CLI installation does not respect aliases

In some projects, components may not install in the desired location that you configured in the aliases in the `components.json` file. This is because we can't use a target path with aliases.

We have filed an [issue on shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/8169), Shadcn added it to the roadmap.

For now, we recommend using the manual installation.

## Installation by CLI adds quotes

If, when you install components via the CLI, it adds unwanted quotes to your strings like this:

```ts
import React from "'react'";
```

this is due to the `cssVariables: false` option in your components.json file.

An [issue](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/8185) and a [PR](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/8186) were created on the shadcn/ui repo to fix this.
