## Verify your versions

| Dependency       | Minimum recommended version |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Motion**       | `≥ 12.18.1`                 |
| **React**        | `≥ 19`                      |
| **Tailwind CSS** | `≥ 4.1.4`                   |

Make sure your environment meets or exceeds these versions to ensure Animate UI remains compatible and stable.

## Documentation display issues

Certain browser extensions can interfere with how the documentation is rendered. Common culprits include:

- **[Screen Shader | Smart Screen Tinting](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/screen-shader-smart-scree/fmlboobidmkelggdainpknloccojpppi?hl=fr&utm_source=ext_sidebar)**

If problems persist after disabling extensions, clear your browser cache and refresh the page.
